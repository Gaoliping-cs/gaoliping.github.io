## About

This is the personal website of 高立平 （Gao Liping）, a software engineer.

I am a software engineer focused on building and analyzing web systems from both an **engineering** and **search engine** perspective.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- software development  
- data analysis  
- technical SEO

This site serves as a long-term place to document technical thinking, experiments, and structured knowledge.
